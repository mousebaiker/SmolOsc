# Name of the experiment. Will be used to store results.
experiment_name: test_small2

# A type of simulation that defines the hardware and methods used to compute
# the results. The resulting values should be the same regardless of the type.
simulation_type: backward_euler

# A numerical simulation timestep. Kept constant throughout simulation.
dt: 0.1

# Total number of iterations done by simulation.
num_iters: 10000

# How often to save results. Solutions will be saved every `checkpoint_frequency` iterations.
# Final solution is always saved.
checkpoint_frequency: 100

# How many equations to use in the simulations. Monodisperse initial condition will be used, unless
# `path_to_initial` is specified.
num_equations: 32767

# Path to initial condition. Initial condition should be a 1D numpy array in a binary format.
# The program uses 1-based indexing for the solution, so the concentration of clusters of size 1 should be
# stored at index 1. Index 0 is unused.
# path_to_initial: /path/to/initial/soluiton.npy

# Rate of cluster fragmenation in Smoluchowski equations.
lambda: 0.05

# Kernel type
kernel_type: 'constant'
